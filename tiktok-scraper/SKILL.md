# TikTok Scraper

> 🎁 **Permanently free · 10 million entries on signup · 1 concurrent window for free users**
> *(Members unlock more parallel windows.)*

## What is this?

A skill that lets **any AI assistant** (Claude Code, WorkBuddy, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, ChatGPT…) scrape TikTok data — video search, creator discovery, hashtag collection, or a specific creator's videos — and return it as a CSV. No Python packages, no headless configuration, no credential management. The AI orchestrates: it generates a task ID, opens a URL in the **user's own browser**, and downloads the result.

**Why a browser + extension?** The actual scrape runs inside the user's real TikTok session (logged in, with the [MonsterGet](https://monsterget.com) browser extension installed). That is what keeps accounts anti-ban safe. There is no server-side TikTok scraping — the data is collected right where the user is already logged in.

## 🌍 Language rule (read before anything else)

**Always communicate with the user in the user's own language.** Every message you print for the user — setup guidance, progress updates, failure explanations, the final result summary — must be in the language the user writes to you in. This skill's instructions are written in English for precision, but that is *not* the language you speak to the user.

- User writes Chinese → reply in Chinese
- User writes Japanese → reply in Japanese
- User writes Spanish / Portuguese / Korean / … → reply in that language
- Never mix two languages in one user-facing message

The zh-CN localized wording for user-facing messages is provided verbatim in the **Appendix** at the end of this file. Use it only when the user's language is Chinese; otherwise translate the English version yourself.

## Architecture (what actually happens)

```
AI ──1. GET {BASE_URL}/api/agent/generate-task-id ──▶ {"taskId":"<uuid>"}
AI ──2. open browser page  {pagePath}?auto=1&agentTaskId={taskId}&{param}=...&count=N
Page (user browser, logged in + extension) ──▶ POST /api/agent/scrape  (creates task with our taskId)
Extension executes scrape in TikTok tab
Page relays rows to server buffer
AI ──3. GET {BASE_URL}/api/agent/delivery/task/{taskId}/status  ──▶ {status:"ready"}
AI ──4. GET {BASE_URL}/api/agent/delivery/task/{taskId}/data    ──▶ CSV download
```

**Key invariant:** the AI generates the taskId itself *before* opening the browser, so it never needs to read the browser address bar.

## Configuration

```text
BASE_URL   = https://monsterget.com      # API host (usually same as SITE_URL)
SITE_URL   = https://monsterget.com      # page host
STATE_FILE = ~/.monsterget/state.json    # persisted settings (browser choice, download dir, …)
```

Override via environment variables: `MONSTERGET_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000` (and optionally `MONSTERGET_SITE_URL`, `MONSTERGET_STATE_DIR`).

**Link rule**: the user-facing links below are written for production (`https://monsterget.com/install`, `https://monsterget.com`). If the platform runs locally, substitute the domain with the configured `SITE_URL` — never show a bare `{SITE_URL}` placeholder to the user. Always produce a full, clickable URL.

## 🧩 Scripts — the runtime

**Resolve the scripts directory once, at the start of the session, and reuse it:**

```bash
SCRIPTS="$HOME/.monsterget/skill/scripts"

if [ ! -d "$SCRIPTS" ]; then
  echo "Skill not installed: run the install instruction first." >&2
  echo "SCRIPTS=$SCRIPTS" >&2
  exit 1
fi
echo "SCRIPTS=$SCRIPTS"
```

Every command below is written as `bash "$SCRIPTS/<name>.sh"`.

### Scripts used in this flow

| Script | When | What it does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `choose-browser.sh <edge\|chrome>` | Installation — user picks a browser | Saves the browser preference (`browser_pref`) to state |
| `run-scrape.sh <pagePath> <param> <value> [count]` | Every scrape | End-to-end: taskId → open browser → verify process → poll → download CSV |
| `set-download-dir.sh [<dir>]` | First scrape (ask once) | Choose where CSVs are saved. No arg = OS default Downloads dir |

> **🚫 Never run `detect-browser.sh`, `check-login.sh`, or `preflight.sh`** — these are archived reference only. The user guarantees all conditions manually. The AI must not call them during installation, before a scrape, or on failure.

### State file (`~/.monsterget/state.json`)

A small JSON key/value store that persists your browser choice, download directory, and last task info:

```json
{"browser_pref":"edge","download_dir":"D:/tiktok-data"}
```

- **`browser_pref`** — the browser the user chose during installation (`edge` or `chrome`). Set by `choose-browser.sh`. Read it at the start of every task to produce the reminder sentence.
- **`download_dir`** — where CSVs are saved. Set by `set-download-dir.sh`.
- Read the file with: `cat ~/.monsterget/state.json`.

## Installation Guide (one-time, ~2 minutes)

> This skill does **no automatic detection** — every condition is verified manually. The AI only reminds, never checks.
>
> Complete the three steps below once, and every subsequent session is ready to scrape.

### Step I — Install the MonsterGet extension

Tell the user (in their language, with full clickable links):

> 要抓取 TikTok 数据，需要先在浏览器安装 MonsterGet 扩展。
>
> 安装页：**https://monsterget.com/install**
>
> 可以安装在 **Chrome** 或 **Edge**。
>
> 装好后告诉我装在了哪个浏览器（回复"Edge"或"Chrome"）。

**Wait for the user to reply** — do not proceed until they confirm which browser.

### Step II — Save the browser choice

The user replied with "Edge" or "Chrome". Save it:

```bash
bash "$SCRIPTS/choose-browser.sh" edge
# → {"ok":true,"browser_pref":"edge"}
```

(Use `chrome` if that is what the user chose.)

### Step III — Tell the user to log in

Tell the user (naming the browser they chose):

> 请在 **{浏览器}**（装了 MonsterGet 扩展的那个）里完成以下两步：
>
> 1. 打开 **https://monsterget.com** 注册并登录
> 2. 打开 **https://www.tiktok.com** 登录你的 TikTok 账号
>
> 都登录好了就可以开始抓取了。我会在每次抓取前提醒你确认条件。

That is it. No detection scripts, no verification loops. The user guarantees the conditions.

> ⚠️ **One-browser rule**: the extension, the monsterget.com login, and the TikTok login must all be in the **same browser** (the one the user chose). If they later switch browsers, re-run Steps I–III.

## Scrape types — auto-discovered once per session

**Fetch the live scrapers list at session start.** This is the single source of truth — the AI uses it to map the user's request to the correct `pagePath` + `param` + `countMax`. New platforms (LinkedIn, etc.) are automatically available the moment they are added server-side; no SKILL.md update needed.

```bash
SCRAPERS="$(curl -s "$BASE_URL/api/agent/scrapers")"
```

Each scraper contains all the info needed to build the scrape URL:

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `type` | `search_video` | Stable identifier |
| `name` | `TikTok 视频搜索` | Human-readable — helps the AI match user intent |
| `page` | `/tiktok-search-video` | Use as `<pagePath>` in `run-scrape.sh` |
| `param` | `query` | Use as `<param>` in `run-scrape.sh` |
| `defaultCount` / `countMax` | `50` / `300` | Default and cap for `<count>` |
| `usage` | `/tiktok-search-video?...` | URL template for reference |

**Rules:**
1. `SCRAPERS` is set **once per session** (at the start, before the first scrape). All scrapes in the same session reuse it.
2. To map the user's request, iterate the scrapers array by `name` (or `type`) to find the matching entry, then extract `page` + `param` + `defaultCount`.
3. Username accepts `@name` or full profile URL (server normalizes).
4. The static table of current TikTok scrapers is moved to the Appendix — it is for human readability only, never for the AI to map against.

## The flow

### 0. Session start — fetch the scraper list (once)

At the **start of the first task of a session**, before anything else, fetch the live scraper list. Keep the result for the whole session — never re-fetch it between tasks in the same conversation:

```bash
SCRAPERS="$(curl -s "$BASE_URL/api/agent/scrapers")"
```

If this fails (platform unreachable), tell the user and stop. See "Scrape types" for how to map a request to `pagePath` + `param` + `countMax`.

### 1. Pre-task reminder (every scrape)

At the **start of every scrape task**, before running any command, read the config and print the reminder sentence:

```bash
cat ~/.monsterget/state.json
```

Then say (in the user's language):

> **我将打开 {browser}（已安装 MonsterGet 扩展），访问 monsterget.com（需已登录），抓取 tiktok.com（需已登录）的指定内容：{user's request}。**

Replace `{browser}` with the value from `browser_pref` (translated: "Edge" or "Chrome"), and `{user's request}` with the specific task the user asked for (e.g. "关于 'mike tyson' 的视频 50 条").

**This sentence is mandatory on every single scrape.** It is the user's only confirmation that the AI is about to open their browser. Do not skip it, shorten it, or merge it into a "processing…" status line.

**Append the window-visibility hint to the same reminder** (one message, not a separate prompt):

> 请缩小当前软件窗口，保持爬虫窗口部分可见（完全遮挡爬虫窗口会影响内容加载，导致抓取失败）。

A fully-covered window gets its rendering throttled by the browser, which stalls the scraper page's loading. Keep the browser window at least partially visible for the scrape to run. This hint goes in every reminder, exactly once, in the user's language.

Proceed to Step 2 without waiting for a reply — the reminder is informational, not a question.

### 2. Run the scrape

**One command does the whole thing** — taskId, browser launch, process verification, polling, download:

```bash
bash "$SCRIPTS/run-scrape.sh" <pagePath> <param> <value> [count]
```

Examples:

```bash
bash "$SCRIPTS/run-scrape.sh" /tiktok-search-video query "mike tyson" 20
# → {"status":"ready","taskId":"...","file":"mike-20-20260905_tiktok_video_ab12cd.csv","rowCount":20,"url":"..."}
```

The script handles, in order:
1. Re-detect the browser (the extension should be installed — user guaranteed it)
2. Generate a taskId
3. Build the URL (`{SITE_URL}{pagePath}?auto=1&agentTaskId=...&{param}=...&count=N`) — **values are URL-encoded by the script**, so spaces and Chinese characters are safe
4. Open it in the detected browser (fire-and-forget)
5. Verify the browser process actually started
6. Poll status every 5s until `ready` / `failed` / `downloaded` / `not_found` (5-minute timeout)
7. Download the CSV with the server's semantic filename into the resolved download dir

#### Read the result

| `status` in output | Meaning | What to do |
|--------------------|---------|------------|
| `ready` | CSV downloaded — `file` is the filename, `dir` the folder, `rowCount` the row count | Show the user a preview + the path |
| `not_found` | The page never created the task (launch failed or extension not ready) | Ask the user to check the 3 conditions (see Step 3) |
| `timeout` | Not ready in 5 min | See Step 3 — checklist |
| `failed` | Task failed on the platform | Report the error |
| `already_downloaded` | The CSV is tombstoned (one download only) | Run again — a new taskId is generated |

#### Verify & present

Show the user the first rows of the CSV so they can confirm the data is correct. State the saved file path — the scrape output carries it in `dir` (the folder) + `file` (the name).

#### Where CSVs are saved

CSVs go to the **OS default Downloads folder** unless the user picks another location. Resolve order (first match wins):

1. `MONSTERGET_DOWNLOAD_DIR` env var (rarely used)
2. `download_dir` in `~/.monsterget/state.json` (the saved choice)
3. the OS default: `~/Downloads` (Linux uses `xdg-user-dir DOWNLOAD` when available)

**Ask once, before the first scrape of a session** — *"CSV 保存到系统下载目录（`<path>`）可以吗？还是换个路径？"* — then persist the answer:

```bash
bash "$SCRIPTS/set-download-dir.sh"                 # user accepted the default
bash "$SCRIPTS/set-download-dir.sh" "D:/tiktok-data" # user gave a path
# → {"ok":true,"dir":"D:/tiktok-data","source":"custom"}
```

The choice persists across sessions, so ask at most once per machine. Never re-ask if `state.json` already has a `download_dir`.

### 3. On failure — user checklist

If the scrape fails (status `not_found`, `timeout`, or the browser never opened), **do not re-run the script** — instead, prompt the user to check the three conditions:

> 抓取失败了，请确认以下 3 项（都在 **{browser}** 里）：
>
> ① **安装了 MonsterGet 扩展吗？**
>    → 打开 https://monsterget.com/install 安装
>
> ② **在安装了扩展的那个浏览器登录了 monsterget.com 吗？**
>    → 打开 https://monsterget.com 登录
>
> ③ **在同一个浏览器登录了 tiktok.com 且能正常访问吗？**
>    → 打开 https://www.tiktok.com 确认
>
> 全部确认后告诉我"好了"，我重新抓取。

Wait for the user to respond, then retry the scrape from Step 2.

### Bulk creator profiles (optional)

When the user needs profile data for **multiple creators at once** (e.g., "get profiles of @mike, @jenifer, @tiktok"), use the `usernames` param with comma-separated values:

```bash
bash "$SCRIPTS/run-scrape.sh" /tiktok-profile usernames "mike,jenifer,tiktok" 3
```

The platform creates a **parent task** that chains through each profile sequentially. The script polls and downloads exactly as with a single scrape — the CSV contains one row per creator with aggregated profile stats.

### Running multiple scrapes (AI-orchestrated, one at a time)

When the user asks for **several scrapes at once**, orchestrate them one at a time — the AI is the conductor:

```bash
# Task 1 → wait → result
bash "$SCRIPTS/run-scrape.sh" /tiktok-search-video query "mike tyson" 20
# → show result to the user (CSV path + preview)

# Task 2 → wait → result
bash "$SCRIPTS/run-scrape.sh" /tiktok-search-user query beauty 5
# → show result

# Task 3 → wait → result
bash "$SCRIPTS/run-scrape.sh" /tiktok-tag query kpop 5
# → final summary
```

Key rules:
- **Do not stop to ask the user between tasks.** Each scrape is independent and should run as soon as the previous one is ready.
- **The pre-task reminder is said once at the start of the batch**, not repeated per task within the batch. Say: *"我将连续抓取以下内容……"* then chain the scrapes.
- **The page already inserts a random 5-10s delay** before the scraper window opens — the AI should not add its own sleep.
- **If a scrape returns `429 too_many_concurrent_scrapes`**, a previous task is still `pending` / `processing` — wait for it to finish, then retry.

## Error handling

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `not_found` / `timeout` | Extension missing, not logged in, or browser launch failed | Run the 3-point user checklist (Step 3) |
| `platform_reachable: false` / curl returns nothing | Platform not reachable | Confirm backend running (local) or site is up (production) |
| page shows "please log in" | Not logged into monsterget.com | Log in at https://monsterget.com, retry |
| `already_downloaded` | Already fetched once | Run the scrape again (new taskId) |
| `409 not_ready` | Data not ready yet | Keep polling |
| `409 buffer_unavailable` | Buffer cleared by TTL race | Retry a few seconds later |
| `429 too_many_concurrent_scrapes` | A previous task is still pending/processing | Free users have 1 concurrent window — wait for the running task to reach `ready`/`failed`, then retry. Closing the browser tab is NOT required |
| `402 insufficient_credits` | Credits exhausted | Signup grants 10M credits — almost never runs out; contact the platform |

## Concurrency note

Free-tier users have **1 concurrent scrape window**. Member tiers can run **up to 10 in parallel**.

The limit counts **running tasks**, not open windows:
- A task counts while it is `pending` or `processing` (the extension is still working).
- The moment a task reaches `ready`, the slot is **freed** — you can open the next scrape right away.
- An open browser tab with a finished task does **NOT** block the next task.
- A `pending` task that was never claimed auto-expires after ~30 seconds.

## Gotchas

- **Use the extension-installed browser.** Never rely on the system default browser — it may not have the extension. The user chose which browser during installation; that browser must have the extension installed.
- **Never re-implement the browser/process/polling logic inline.** The scripts are the single source of truth — that is what makes this work identically across AI clients and operating systems.
- **Keep the tab open** until the task reaches `ready`. Closing the tab before the extension reports results means no server copy is produced.
- After downloading, show the user the CSV path and a preview so they trust the result.
- **Say the account-risk line once per batch**, before the first scrape: this drives the user's real TikTok account, and bulk collection may violate TikTok's ToS — the user's account, the user's responsibility.
- **The pre-task reminder (Step 1) exists because the user opted out of auto-detection.** It is the user's only signal that the browser is about to open. Never skip it.
- **Never run `detect-browser.sh`, `check-login.sh`, or `preflight.sh`.** They exist in the scripts directory but are deliberately unused — the AI must never call them.

## Appendix — zh-CN localized user-facing copy

> Use the Chinese wording below **only** when the user writes to you in Chinese. For all other languages, translate the English text in the body yourself. Never show this appendix to the user.

### Current scraper types (for reference only — the AI fetches live data, never uses this table)

| Type | pagePath | Param | Default | Max |
|------|----------|-------|---------|-----|
| Video search | `/tiktok-search-video` | `query` | 50 | 300 |
| Creator search | `/tiktok-search-user` | `query` | 30 | 300 |
| Hashtag search | `/tiktok-tag` | `query` | 30 | 300 |
| Creator videos | `/tiktok-user-videos` | `username` | 50 | 300 |
| Creator profile | `/tiktok-profile` | `username` | 1 | 1 |

### Installation Guide (中文)

**Step I — 安装扩展**

```
要抓取 TikTok 数据，需要先在浏览器安装 MonsterGet 扩展。

安装页：https://monsterget.com/install

可以安装在 Chrome 或 Edge。

装好后告诉我装在了哪个浏览器（回复"Edge"或"Chrome"）。
```

**User replied → save choice:**

装了 Edge 就写 `bash "$SCRIPTS/choose-browser.sh" edge`，装了 Chrome 就写 `bash "$SCRIPTS/choose-browser.sh" chrome`。

**Step III — 引导登录**

```
请在 {浏览器}（装了 MonsterGet 扩展的那个）里完成以下两步：

1. 打开 https://monsterget.com 注册并登录
2. 打开 https://www.tiktok.com 登录你的 TikTok 账号

都登录好了就可以开始抓取了。我会在每次抓取前提醒你确认条件。
```

### Pre-task reminder (中文)

每次任务前先读配置，然后说：

```
我将打开 {浏览器}（已安装 MonsterGet 扩展），
访问 monsterget.com（需已登录），
抓取 tiktok.com（需已登录）的指定内容：{用户的具体请求}。

请缩小当前软件窗口，保持爬虫窗口部分可见（完全遮挡爬虫窗口会影响内容加载，导致抓取失败）。
```

`{浏览器}` 替换成 `browser_pref` 的值（edge 译成"Edge"，chrome 译成"Chrome"）。

### Failure checklist (中文)

```
抓取失败了，请确认以下 3 项（都在 {浏览器} 里）：

① 安装了 MonsterGet 扩展吗？
   → 打开 https://monsterget.com/install 安装

② 在安装了扩展的那个浏览器登录了 monsterget.com 吗？
   → 打开 https://monsterget.com 登录

③ 在同一个浏览器登录了 tiktok.com 且能正常访问吗？
   → 打开 https://www.tiktok.com 确认

全部确认后告诉我"好了"，我重新抓取。
```
